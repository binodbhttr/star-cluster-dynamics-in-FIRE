# star-cluster-dynamics-in-FIRE
This repo is dedicated to studying the dynamics of star clusters in FIRE simulations. The repo contains gas and clusters data of different versions of the simulations and their visualization. 

This repo is more of a backup of data and visualizations for easy sharing. Sorry for all the clutter.
